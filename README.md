Term Thesis - JShelter: Integration Tests

The theoretical part of the Bachelor's Thesis, including JShelter, problematics, existing technologies and solutions, and a test design.

1) Get familiar with the JShelter project and focus on the Network Boundary Shield and the Fingerprinting Detector. Describe the JavaScript Shield protections that deal with special peripherals (such as geolocation, magnetometer, other sensors, peripherals for virtual reality, and other special devices). Compare the Network Boundary Shield with Googleâ€™s Private Network Access (PNA).
2) Study containerization using Docker, focusing on how to create custom networks and virtualize peripherals.
3) Design a way to virtualize the peripherals protected by JShelter, and based on that, propose missing tests for the JavaScript Shield. Create tests for the Network Boundary Shield and the Fingerprinting Detector using a Docker network. Write the tests for the Network Boundary Shield so that they can also be used for testing PNA.
